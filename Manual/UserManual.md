## Using the CLI Mode

The Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based version of the Car Rental System designed for both users and administrators. It allows full access to core features using typed commands and menus.

The CLI mode runs entirely in the terminal. You'll see a menu like this:

```
===== Car Rental System =====
1. Book Car
2. View All User Booked Cars
3. View All Bookings
4. View Available Cars
5. View Available Electric Cars
6. View All Users
7. Sort Cars by Price (Ascending)
8. Filter Cars by Price Range
9. Search Cars by Keyword
10. Export Available Cars to CSV
11. Book Car and Export Booking to CSV
12. Cancel Booking
13. Register New User
14. Login User
0. Exit
==============================

Select an option: 
```

Use numbers to select options and follow the prompts.

>Compared to the GUI, which is designed for direct interaction by a single user at a time, the **CLI version serves more like an administrative console**, offering features tailored for system operators or backend administrators.
>
>In addition to standard features such as booking and searching cars, the CLI includes **exclusive administrative functions** like:
>
>- **Viewing all registered users**
>- **Listing all bookings in the system**
>- **Viewing all cars booked by a specific user**
>- **Exporting individual booking records to separate CSV files**
>
>These capabilities make the CLI mode ideal for testing, bulk reviewing, or backend control, while the GUI mode focuses on delivering a user-friendly experience for day-to-day rental operations.
