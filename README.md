## Brief Description

This project implements a command-line car rental system using Java, designed with a clean Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. 

It enables users to interact with the system through a text-based menu, supporting operations such as browsing available vehicles, booking cars, viewing bookings, and managing user data. Additional features like search, filtering, and CSV exports improve usability and simulate real-world rental service operations.

The system uses structured CSV files for data persistence and offers a menu-driven, interactive experience.

This system addresses real-world needs for accessible and flexible rental options, particularly in areas with limited public transportation, providing a user-friendly rental experience via simple yet effective backend services.

## Compile and Run

You can run the Car Rental System using either the **command line** or an **IDE** (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse). Both options are explained below.



### Using Command Line

Make sure you have **Java 17 or later** installed and configured in your system PATH.

Compile the project using your IDE or via terminal:

```bash
javac -d out src/main/java/student/Main.java
```

Run the program:

```bash
java -cp out student.Main
```

When prompted:

```
Launch in CLI or GUI mode? (cli/gui):
```

Type `cli` to run in command-line mode, or `gui` to launch the Swing GUI.



### Using an IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse)

#### IntelliJ IDEA
